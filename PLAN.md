# Plan: Merge `non-docker-dependent` Branch into `master`

## Context

PR #96 (`non-docker-dependent`) already removed Docker and replaced it with a
native Windows stack (PowerShell launcher + PySide6 GUI + vendored binaries).
This plan tracks the remaining work needed before that branch can land on
`master` as the new default.

What is **already done** on `non-docker-dependent`:

- `docker-compose.yml`, `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/`, `launcher/`,
  `setup.ps1`, all `scripts/start*` and `scripts/setup-*` deleted.
- Single root launcher `LocalAIStack.ps1` with subcommands
  (`-InitEnv`, `-Setup`, `-Start`, `-Stop`, `-Build`, `-CheckUpdates`,
  `-Admin`, `-Help`).
- Step helpers in `scripts/steps/` (`prereqs.ps1`, `download.ps1`,
  `process.ps1`, `venvs.ps1`).
- Native Qt GUI under `gui/` (PySide6 + QtCharts):
  - `gui/windows/chat.py` — chat (SSE, `QTextBrowser`, no WebEngine)
  - `gui/windows/login.py`
  - `gui/windows/admin.py` (read-only)
  - `gui/windows/metrics.py` (QtCharts VRAM plots)
  - `gui/widgets/tray.py` (`QSystemTrayIcon`)
- Backend defaults swapped from `http://ollama:11434` etc. to `127.0.0.1`.
- `backend/model_resolver.py` + `config/model-sources.yaml` for HF/Ollama
  registry polling with offline fallback.
- Web search via `BraveSearchProvider` / `DuckDuckGoProvider`
  (SearXNG removed entirely).
- `backend/seed_admin.py` for first-run admin bootstrap.
- `tests/test_docker_setup.py` deleted; `test_config.py` and
  `test_diagnostics.py` rewritten for the native layout.

What is **still missing** (the subject of this plan):

1. The launcher's `-InitEnv` only writes a template; user requirements say
   nothing should ever be hand-edited. We need a true setup wizard.
2. Admin auth is still magic-link only; user requirements say the wizard must
   collect an admin **email + password**.
3. Cloudflare Tunnel is documented as "BYO native cloudflared"; user
   requirements say the wizard must launch the Cloudflare dashboard, drive
   `cloudflared tunnel login`, and provision a tunnel automatically.
4. There is no end-user installer — only the developer flow
   (`git clone` + `LocalAIStack.ps1 -Setup`). User requirements say it must
   ship as an installable `.exe` with an install wizard.
5. The admin Qt window is read-only; the old Preact admin panel had write
   parity that we should not regress.

This plan addresses 1–5 in order, calls out sticking points, and sequences
the merge so nothing on `master` breaks during the transition.

## Phase 1 — Audit & sticking points

Before writing any new code, walk the diff between `master` and
`non-docker-dependent` and tag every callsite that still assumes Docker. The
PR description covers the obvious deletions; this phase is about finding the
**non-obvious** survivors.

### 1.1 Code paths to re-audit

| Area | What to verify | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| `backend/main.py` startup | All service URLs default to `127.0.0.1`, not container DNS | Backend boots before services? Health-wait already in `LocalAIStack.ps1` — confirm timeout is generous enough for cold Ollama starts (first model load can take 60–90 s). |
| `backend/diagnostics.py` | `check_searxng` is gone; web-search check uses provider abstraction | A leftover SearXNG probe will fail closed on every `-Start`. |
| `backend/rag.py` | Qdrant URL reads `QDRANT_URL` env (default `http://127.0.0.1:6333`) | RAG was the most container-coupled module. |
| `backend/admin.py` | `_admin_emails()` still keys off `ADMIN_EMAILS` env; needs a path that also accepts the wizard-seeded admin record from SQLite. | Wizard writes to DB, not env. |
| `backend/auth.py` | Magic-link path must keep working for non-admin users; password path is **additive**, not a replacement. | Don't break end-user login. |
| `backend/db.py` | Confirm SQLite path resolves to `data/lai.db` on Windows (no Docker volume mount). | Path quoting on Windows is the usual offender. |
| `backend/history_store.py` | AES-GCM key derivation reads `HISTORY_SECRET_KEY` then falls back to `AUTH_SECRET_KEY`. Both must be set by the wizard before backend boots. | Boot order: wizard writes `.env` → launcher loads `.env` → uvicorn starts. |
| `tools/jupyter_tool.py` | `JUPYTER_TOKEN` now generated per-run by the launcher (random GUID). | Old code hardcoded `local-ai-stack-token`. |
| `tools/web_search.py` | Routes through `middleware/web_search.py` provider, not SearXNG. | Already done in PR #96; verify no orphan `searxng` imports. |
| `config/models.yaml` | `tiers.vision.endpoint` points at `http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1`. | Same. |
| `tests/test_config.py` | New positive assertions for native layout (compose file gone, root launcher present). | Already done. |
| `tests/test_backends_live.py` | Gated by `LIVE_BACKEND_TESTS=1`; rewrite probes to use loopback URLs. | Currently still references container hostnames. |

**Action:** open each file and grep for the regex
`(http://(ollama|qdrant|llama-server|searxng|jupyter|n8n|redis):)` —
any hit is a bug. Treat the audit as a one-pass checklist; do not
"fix while reading", just record findings to a follow-up task list.

### 1.2 Sticking points (genuine risks)

These are the items most likely to break something during the merge.

**S1. Magic-link → password auth migration is one-way.**
The DB schema needs a `password_hash` column on `users` and a new
`password_reset_tokens` table. Once a `master` install upgrades to the new
schema, you cannot downgrade without dropping `data/lai.db`. Mitigation:
ship the migration in `backend/db.py::_migrate_*` with a clear schema
version bump (`v3 → v4`) and document the irreversibility in
`LocalAIStack.ps1 -Help` (the existing v2→v3 note is the template).

**S2. `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var is no longer the source of truth.**
`backend/admin.py::is_admin_email` currently uses `ADMIN_EMAILS` to gate
the `/admin/*` endpoints. After the wizard, admin status is stored in the
`users` table (`is_admin BOOL`). The env var should become a *fallback*
seed only — if a row already has `is_admin = 1`, that wins. Don't delete
the env path; it's how CI tests admin endpoints without a wizard run.

**S3. Cloudflare cohabitation.**
The PR description warns that two cloudflared instances flap. The wizard
must check whether `cloudflared.exe` is already running (via
`Get-Process cloudflared`) and refuse to start a second copy. If the user
already has a tunnel, the wizard offers to **adopt** it (read existing
`%USERPROFILE%\.cloudflared\config.yml`) instead of provisioning a new one.

**S4. CHAT_HOSTNAME is hardcoded in the env template.**
`.env` ships with `CHAT_HOSTNAME=chat.mylensandi.com`, which is the
maintainer's personal domain. The wizard must overwrite this with the
hostname returned by the Cloudflare API after tunnel creation, or — if
the user picks "local-only" — set it to `localhost` and force-disable the
host-gating middleware path in `backend/main.py`.

**S5. `vendor/` and `data/` paths break under
`%PROGRAMFILES%\LocalAIStack`.**
The launcher computes `$RepoRoot` from its own location, which works for
git clones but not for an installed app where the launcher lives in
read-only `Program Files` and the data should live in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\LocalAIStack`. The packaging step must split these:
`$RepoRoot` keeps code/binaries; introduce `$Script:UserDataRoot` for
`data\`, `.env`, and logs. This is the largest single change in the
plan — gate it behind `$env:LAI_INSTALLED -eq '1'` so the dev flow still
works from a checkout.

**S6. PySide6 wheel size.**
Full PySide6 is ~180 MB; Essentials is ~120 MB. The installer download is
already dominated by Ollama models (24–72 GB), so size is a non-issue.
Stick with full PySide6 to keep `QtCharts` available.

**S7. Test coverage during the transition.**
The CI matrix on `master` runs `pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_results.txt`
in a Linux container. After the merge, the same suite must pass without
Docker. PR #96 already adapted `test_config.py` and `test_diagnostics.py`;
verify the CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) doesn't `docker
build` anywhere. If it does, replace with a plain `pip install -r
backend/requirements.txt` + `pytest`.

---

## Phase 2 — First-run setup wizard

Replace the dumb `-InitEnv` template-writer with a real PySide6 `QWizard`
that collects every value the stack needs and writes a fully-populated
`.env` (mode 600). The user never opens `.env` themselves.

### 2.1 Where it lives

New module `gui/windows/setup_wizard.py`. Reuses the existing GUI venv
(`vendor\venv-gui`) and the existing `gui/api_client.py` for the final
"register admin" call. Spawned by the launcher when:

```
LocalAIStack.ps1 -Setup    # always run; idempotent
LocalAIStack.ps1 -Start    # only if .env is missing OR no admin user exists
```

The launcher decides whether to spawn the wizard via a fast SQLite check
in `backend/seed_admin.py --check-only` (already exists; widen its
contract to also report "no admin user").

### 2.2 Wizard pages

Each page is a `QWizardPage` with field validation; `Next` is disabled
until the page is valid. Pages 4 and 5 are skippable.

1. **Welcome** — one-paragraph explanation, no fields. Detects whether
   prereqs (Ollama, Python, NVIDIA driver, cloudflared) are installed
   and shows green/red icons. "Install missing" button shells out to
   `LocalAIStack.ps1 -Setup -SkipModels` in a worker thread with a
   progress log streamed via `QPlainTextEdit`.

2. **Admin account**
   - Email (`QLineEdit`, regex-validated)
   - Password (`QLineEdit` with `setEchoMode(Password)`, min 12 chars,
     zxcvbn score ≥ 3 — vendored copy in `vendor\venv-gui` from the
     `zxcvbn` PyPI package; falls back to a length+entropy heuristic
     if the import fails)
   - Confirm password
   - The only output of this page is two strings held in
     `wizard.field("admin_email")` and `wizard.field("admin_password")`.
     Nothing is written to disk yet.

3. **Secrets (no user input)**
   - Generates `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` and `HISTORY_SECRET_KEY` via
     `secrets.token_urlsafe(48)`.
   - Page renders as "Generating cryptographic keys… ✓" with a 200 ms
     fake delay so the user sees what's happening.
   - Values are held in wizard fields; not yet persisted.

4. **Public access (Cloudflare Tunnel) — skippable**
   - Radio buttons: "Local-only" / "Public via Cloudflare Tunnel".
   - "Public" reveals two fields: domain (e.g. `mylensandi.com`) and
     desired chat hostname (default `chat.<domain>`).
   - "Connect to Cloudflare" button kicks off the flow described in
     Phase 3. Wizard cannot advance until the flow either succeeds,
     errors out, or the user reverts to "Local-only".

5. **Email delivery (SMTP) — skippable**
   - Used only for magic-link emails to *non-admin* users. The admin
     user already has a password and never needs SMTP.
   - Default state: skip (radio "Skip — print magic links to logs").
   - Optional fields: SMTP host/port/user/pass/from-address/STARTTLS.
   - If skipped, sets `SMTP_HOST=` (empty) in `.env`; backend already
     handles this by logging links instead.

6. **Models — skippable but recommended**
   - List of tier groups from `config/model-sources.yaml` with size
     estimates and checkboxes (`minimal` ≈ 7 GB, `tiers` ≈ 60 GB,
     `vision` ≈ 25 GB).
   - "Download now" runs `python -m backend.model_resolver resolve
     --pull` in a worker thread; progress shown live.
   - Skipping is fine — the user can re-run from the admin panel later.

7. **Finish**
   - Atomically writes `.env` (write to `.env.tmp`, `os.replace`).
   - Calls `python -m backend.seed_admin --email --password --admin`
     to insert the admin row with `passlib`-hashed password.
   - Closes wizard; launcher continues into `-Start`.

### 2.3 Where values land

The wizard writes a single `.env` file at the repo root (or
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\LocalAIStack\.env` once Phase 5 splits user data — see
S5). Contents after a successful run:

```
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=<48-char base64>           # auto-generated
HISTORY_SECRET_KEY=<48-char base64>        # auto-generated
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://chat.<domain>      # or http://localhost:18000
CHAT_HOSTNAME=chat.<domain>                # or localhost
ADMIN_API_ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=ddg                    # or brave if BRAVE_API_KEY supplied
BRAVE_API_KEY=<optional>
HF_TOKEN=<optional>
SMTP_HOST=...                              # blank if skipped
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_ID=<uuid>                # written by Phase 3 flow
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_NAME=local-ai-stack
MODEL_UPDATE_POLICY=prompt
```

Admin email + password go to **SQLite** (`users` table), not `.env`.

### 2.5 Backend changes required

- `backend/db.py::_migrate_*` — schema bump v3 → v4, adds
  `password_hash TEXT NULL` and `is_admin INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`
  to `users`.
- `backend/auth.py` — new `verify_password()` and
  `POST /auth/password` route. Magic-link routes stay as-is for
  non-admin users. Add a `password_required` flag on the user row;
  admins are required to use a password, end-users still magic-link.
- `backend/seed_admin.py` — accept `--email`, `--password`, `--admin`
  flags; idempotent (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`).
- `backend/admin.py::is_admin_email` → renamed to `is_admin_user`,
  reads `is_admin` from SQLite first, falls back to `ADMIN_EMAILS` env
  for CI.
- New dep in `backend/requirements.txt`: `passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4`.

### 2.4 Re-running the wizard

`LocalAIStack.ps1 -Setup` always re-runs the wizard, but each page reads
its current value from `.env` / SQLite and pre-fills. The user can step
through to change a single field (e.g. rotate the Cloudflare tunnel) and
the rest are no-ops. This is the supported "edit env" UX — there is no
file the user is expected to open in a text editor.
